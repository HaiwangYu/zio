#+title: ZIO - a simplified, high level C++ interface to ZeroMQ and Zyre.

* Introduction

ZIO provides an abstraction layer on top of general ZeroMQ
functionality and in particular that provided by Zyre which allow for
simplified development of distributed applications and libraries.

Some of the features ZIO provides include:

- a "logger object" type interface to emitting messages supporting
  both free form text strings as well as structured data metrics ([[file:docs/outbox.org][outbox]]).

- a high level, but still general message format ([[file:docs/messages.org][messages]] and [[file:docs/format.org][format]])

- interface to Zyre peer discovery, persistence and reaction ([[file:docs/peer.org][peer]])

- a "ported graph" abstraction which provides network topology
  self-assembly and which may be used to develop distributed
  applications that follow the /data flow programming/ paradigm ([[file:docs/node.org][node]]
  and [[file:docs/port.org][port]]).

- some message processing batteries included ([[file:docs/batteries.org][batteries]]).

* Documentation

The links in the intro go to detailed descriptions of the major
features.  Coming soon to a repo near you are:

- [[file:docs/tutorial.org][Tutorial]] simple steps to get started
- [[file:docs/howto.org][How-To]] starting point for achieving specific goals

Until then, here's how to install ZIO:

#+begin_example
  $ ./waf configure --prefix=/path/to/install
  $ [./waf build --alltests]
  $ ./waf install [--notests]
#+end_example
