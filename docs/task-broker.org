The ZIO task broker is essentially a rip off of ZeroMQ [[https://github.com/zeromq/majordomo][majordomo]] aka [[http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#toc98][service
oriented reliable queueing]] pattern with some variation:

- It is more generic ("generaldomo"?) in that clients and services are
  not directly matched by simply a hard-wired service name but by
  applying a factory pattern as is done with the [[file:flow-broker.org][ZIO flow broker]].

- Use of SERVER socket type instead of ROUTER to allow for clients to
  use CLIENT and thus operate in a thread-safe manner in a changing
  and multi-threaded context.
