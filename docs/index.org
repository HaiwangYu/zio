ZIO provides a high-level interface to ZeroMQ, Zyre and some patterns
described in the [[http://zguide.zeromq.org/][zguide]].  It also provides a /ported graph/ model for
constructing a network topology.  Some of the features ZIO provides
include:

- a "logger object" type interface to emitting messages supporting
  both free form text strings as well as structured data metrics ([[file:outbox.org][outbox]]).

- a high level, but still general message format ([[file:messages.org][messages]] and [[file:format.org][format]])

- interface to Zyre peer discovery, persistence and reaction ([[file:peer.org][peer]])

- a "ported graph" abstraction which provides network topology
  self-assembly and which may be used to develop distributed
  applications that follow the /data flow programming/ paradigm ([[file:node.org][node]]
  and [[file:port.org][port]]).

- some message processing batteries included ([[file:batteries.org][batteries]]).

- A [[file:api.org][C++ API]] and matching [[file:python.org][Python package]]

- A Python [[file:flow-broker.org][flow broker]] with behavior specific components such as an [[file:hdfexample.org][HDF5 file service example]]
