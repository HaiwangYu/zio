#+title: ZIO - a simplified, high level C++ interface to ZeroMQ and Zyre.

* Introduction

ZIO provides a high-level interface to ZeroMQ, Zyre and some patterns
described in the [[http://zguide.zeromq.org/][zguide]].  It also provides a /ported graph/ model for
constructing a network topology.

Some of the features ZIO provides include:

- a "logger object" type interface to emitting messages supporting
  both free form text strings as well as structured data metrics ([[file:docs/outbox.org][outbox]]).

- a high level, but still general message format ([[file:docs/messages.org][messages]] and [[file:docs/format.org][format]])

- interface to Zyre peer discovery, persistence and reaction ([[file:docs/peer.org][peer]])

- a "ported graph" abstraction which provides network topology
  self-assembly and which may be used to develop distributed
  applications that follow the /data flow programming/ paradigm ([[file:docs/node.org][node]]
  and [[file:docs/port.org][port]]).

- some message processing batteries included ([[file:docs/batteries.org][batteries]]).

* Documentation

The links in the intro go to detailed descriptions of the major
features.  Coming soon to a repo near you are:

- [[file:docs/tutorial.org][Tutorial]] simple steps to get started
- [[file:docs/howto.org][How-To]] starting point for achieving specific goals

Until then, here's how to install ZIO:

#+begin_example
  $ ./waf configure --prefix=/path/to/install
  $ [./waf build --alltests -j1]
  $ ./waf install [--notests]
#+end_example
