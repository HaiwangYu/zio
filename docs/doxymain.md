Welcome to the ZIO Doxygen pages.

ZIO provides a high-level interface to ZeroMQ, Zyre and some patterns
described in the [zguide](http://zguide.zeromq.org/).  It also provides a *ported graph* model for
constructing a network topology.

Documentation is at <https://brettviren.github.io/zio> or browsing the files under <./docs/>.
