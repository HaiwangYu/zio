#+title: ToDo

- [ ] zio is not a great name for this package as one of its main
  goals is to hide the "z".  Given it provides a graph metaphor,
  GraphIO or GIO is better.  "graphio" is already used by libraries
  providing graph representation serialization and by a drawing
  program.  None apparent that provide an graph oriented I/O system.
  
- [ ] Add poller and reactor pattern.

- [ ] Include reacting to Zyre events.

- [ ] Track peers to which a node connects so as to provide
  information on their disappearance and possible later reappearance.

- [ ] To support extracting / injecting data with WCT components needs
  (a) to be thread-safe when ~TbbFlow~ is used, (b) to not drop buffered
  messages when the WCT graph execution is complete.  These two things
  likely require a solution based on a synchronous query/response
  protocol with CLIENT/SERVER sockets.
