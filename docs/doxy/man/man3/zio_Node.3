.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
An identified vertex in a ported, directed graph\&. 

Each port (a \fBzio::Port\fP) is named uniquely within the node and has a ZeroMQ socket which may (simultaneously) bind and connect\&.
.PP
Every bind is advertised for discovery by a \fBzio::Peer\fP\&.
.PP
Each connect may be direct which completes immediately or indirect (given based on node/port names) which waits for peer discovery to resolve\&.
.PP
Nodes start in 'offline' state\&. During that state, ports may be created\&. The ports also start in 'offline' state and while offline they may bind() or connect()\&. When a node is brought 'online' it brings all ports 'online' and it is then when any bind() or connect() and associated discovery are performed\&. A node and its ports may be taken subsequently 'offline' and the cycle repeated\&.
