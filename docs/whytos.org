#+title: ZIO design discussion
#+setupfile: setup.org
#+include: nav.org

During the course of development, a number of design documents are
written to help solidify thoughts. 

- A [[file:node.org][node]] collects [[file:port.org][ports]] to implement a network of ZIO applications as a ported graph.
- A [[file:peer.org][peer]] provides distributed discovery and presence
- A [[file:messages.org][message]] schema is used for all ZIO messages.
- An [[file:outbox.org][outbox]] gives "logger" type interface to emit free text strings or structured metrics
- A protocol called [[file:flow.org][flow]] provides simpler message transfer than using ports directly 
- A [[file:flow-broker.org][broker]] can be constructed for richer flows
