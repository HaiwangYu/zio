#+title: ZIO design discussion
#+setupfile: setup.org
#+include: nav.org

During the course of development, a number of design documents are
written to help solidify thoughts. 

- An attempt at a [[file:big-picture.org][big picture]].
- A [[file:logging.org][logging]] interface is used and provided to users of the ZIO C++ library.
- A [[file:node.org][node]] collects [[file:port.org][ports]] to implement a network of ZIO applications as a ported graph.
- A [[file:peer.org][peer]] provides distributed discovery and presence
- A [[file:messages.org][message]] schema is used for all ZIO messages.
- An [[file:outbox.org][outbox]] gives "logger" type interface to emit free text strings or structured metrics
- A protocol called [[file:flow.org][flow]] provides simpler message transfer than using ports directly 
- A [[file:flow-broker.org][flow broker]] brings flow clients together with server-side flow handlers, such as those that may manage file resources.
- A [[file:task-broker.org][task broker]] implements (as [[file:domo.org][domo]]) a reliable service oriented task queue based on ZeroMQ majordomo design.

- Utility support to pack [[file:tensors.org][tensors]] into messages.
