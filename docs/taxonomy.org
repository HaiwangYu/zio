#+title: ZIO Taxonomy

ZIO provides a /ported graph/ ([[file:node.org][node]], [[file:port.org][port]]) abstraction to network
topology.  Behavior of sets of nodes and ports may be arbitrary but
certain behavior can be called out to form a taxonomy.

* Spray and Pray

The [[file:outbox.org][spray-and-pray]] (SAP) behavior is when a node has something to say
but doesn't care who hears it.  When used with PUB/SUB sockets, it is
useful for emitting logging and metrics in an M-to-N pattern.  When
used with PUSH/PULL it may be used to form the "scatter" in a
scatter-gather pattern.

* Flow

The [[file:flow.org][flow]] behavior is for uni-directional transfer of data from one
node to another in a quasi-synchronous manner.  It strictly uses
CLIENT/SERVER.
