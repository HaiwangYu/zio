#+title: ZIO Domo Protocol
#+setupfile: setup.org

ZIO domo protocol is a generalization of ZeroMQ Majordomo v1 (RFC
7/MDP) to use either CLIENT/SERVER or DEALER/ROUTER sockets.  A C++
and Python implementation of the broker and the client and worker APIs
are provided.

The ZIO domo code is largely an import of the initial prototype in 
https://github.com/brettviren/generaldomo

For now, see it's documentation.  The ~generaldomo::~ namespace becomes
~zio::domo::~ here.  The sub commands from the command line Python
program ~generaldomo~ becomes sub commands under the command line Python
program ~zio~.
